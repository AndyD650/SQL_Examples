--  This is a query to generate a report of the month over month growth (or lack there of) of posts.  This was initially for a website, but could be easily reworked.

SELECT date_trunc('month', p.created_at)::DATE AS date,
       COUNT(*) AS count, 
       ROUND(
       ((COUNT(*) - LAG(COUNT(*), 1) OVER (ORDER BY date_trunc('month', p.created_at)::DATE, 1))
       / LAG(COUNT(*),1) OVER (ORDER BY date_trunc('month', p.created_at)::DATE, 1)::FLOAT4 * 100)::NUMERIC,1)  || '%' AS percent_growth
FROM posts p
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
